# 🔐 Secret Message Vault

**Secret Message Vault** is my first Firebase-powered web application that allows users to share secret messages securely and anonymously.

Once a message is created, a unique link is generated that can be shared with anyone. The twist? The message can be viewed **only once** — after it's opened, it's **automatically deleted** from the database, keeping it private and temporary.
